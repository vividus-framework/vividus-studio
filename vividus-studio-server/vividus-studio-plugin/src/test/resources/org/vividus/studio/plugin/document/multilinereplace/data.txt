Scenario: VIVIDUS is a continuously growing collection of testing actions and
utilities combined into a one-box application to enable human-readable
tests.socket
When I wait with `PT30S` timeout until count of text messages received over `echo` websocket is greater than `0`
When I drain text messages received over `echo` websocket to scenario variable `messages`
Then `${messages[0]}` is equal to `${message}`
When I disconnect from `echo` websocket
